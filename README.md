# audition_scheduler_app

audiiton_scheduler_app is a web application for the use of scheduling theater auditions.  It allows users to sign up with their contact information and then create theater events for which other users can sign up.  The key feature is that auditioners can see what pieces other actors are preparing, so they can if they so choose, prepare a different piece to make for a more diverse and stimulating experience for everyone involved.  Each event has a default setting of ten audition slots, ideal for an hour's experience of one actor per five minutes with one minute transition time between each actor.  The event coordinator could easily create a new event at each subsequent hour to allow for more actors.

audition scheduler app utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ExpressJS, Underscore, Bootstrap, Nodemon, Heroku, and MongoDB.
